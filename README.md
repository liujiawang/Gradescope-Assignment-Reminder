### General Idea
This is a chrome extension that allows users to add their assignment due dates from Gradescope.com to calendars. The motivation of this project came from missing deadlines from previous courses. Currently, Gradescope.com doesnâ€™t have the option to send notifications for approaching deadlines. So we developed an assignment reminder add-in that can be helpful to students and easy to use.
